# FREmus - New Version for FREmu: Power Spectrum Emulator for f(R) Gravity

## What's New?

- Added support for linear regime of $P(k)$ ($-4<\log_{10}(k)<0$).
- Added support for Fast Emulation without boosts and computations of fiducial cosmology, so the emulator can be used for more complicated computations, e.g. $C_\ell$, $\xi_{\pm}$.
- Strenthened the performance of the emulator with more smoothed boosts (less noise) where the fiducial non-linear power spectra contain massive neutrinos.
- Halo Mass Functions (HMFs)! (TBD)
